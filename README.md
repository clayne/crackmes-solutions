My solutions to some crackmes of crackmes.one

In this repository I will be adding the information of different crackmes that I have been doing (simply for fun and learn). 

I have been documented as good as I know.

All these solutions are the result of my learning, so it is very likely that they contain some errors, of concept, of procedure or even of interpretation of the code. Use it as a guide but you are welcome to comment or correct or anything you do not consider correct.
