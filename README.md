# crackmes - solutions
My solutions to some crackmes that I have been collecting from the internet.

I have been doing (simply for fun and learn) and documented as good as I know.

Are ordered them by folders to classify them by different sources.

If you want to send me some crackme, contact me on [Twitter](#Contact).

In many cases, the notes taken in each crackme do not have a sequential or chronological order. They have only been added as they have been checking or detecting different functions or features. They are simply data that globally serve us to understand some parts of the whole. You have to understand that the reversing process involves following the code many times in many different ways and not everything looks the same way and at the same time.

All these solutions are the result of my learning, so it is very likely that they contain some errors, of concept, of procedure or even of interpretation of the code. Use it as a guide but you are welcome to comment or correct or anything you do not consider correct.
